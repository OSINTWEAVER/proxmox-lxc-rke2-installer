# RKE2 LXC Deployment Status

## Current Status: FAILED ❌

**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Conclusion**: RKE2 deployment in LXC containers is **NOT VIABLE**

## Root Cause

Kubernetes kubelet's ContainerManager cannot parse empty cgroup resource values provided by LXC containers in cgroup v2 environments. This causes the kubelet to fail startup with:

```
strconv.Atoi: parsing "": invalid syntax
```

## Impact

- ❌ kubelet cannot start
- ❌ No node registration  
- ❌ No pod scheduling
- ❌ No container management
- ❌ Complete cluster failure

## Technical Details

While SQLite configuration and token authentication were successfully implemented, the fundamental cgroup incompatibility makes this deployment approach unusable.

## Recommendation

**Use full VMs instead of LXC containers** for RKE2 deployment. LXC containers are not suitable for Kubernetes workloads due to cgroup v2 implementation differences.

## Alternative Solutions

1. **Proxmox VMs**: Deploy RKE2 on full virtual machines
2. **K3s Testing**: Evaluate if K3s handles LXC better than RKE2
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Use managed Kubernetes services
4. **Container Runtime**: Use Docker/Podman on VMs instead of LXC
